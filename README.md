#SFML VS2013 SampleProject

###What is it?

This is a sample project for Visual Studio 2013 that utilizes the Simple and Fast Media Layer.

###What's so special about it?

It is a good project to start programming games in C++ using a cross platform library. It is what I would call a batteries included project. 
You don't need to touch your project settings at all to get a game running. It keeps all of the ugly project set up away for people that just want to program a game.

###Does it **only** work with Visual Studio 2013?

Yes. The solution itself works on Visual Studio 2013 Express through Ultimate. Older versions are not supported. You can just gank the source code out of it and use it in any other project though.

###Cool, so this is all you need to make games?

No, you will also need to download SFML. At the moment, SFML doesn't support Visual Studio 2013. You can [download a compatible version here](https://github.com/rskulles/SFML_2.1_VS2013/).
Also, you will need to have some environment variables set up in your operating system. If you have no idea what that means or you just want them set up auto-magically, [use the file here](https://github.com/rskulles/SFML_User_Variables_Script/). 

If you don't use the other utilities I provided, you are on your own. If you do use the utilities, your are on your own.

###Sweet! Now can I make games?

Go for it.

###Am I going to need a doctorate in computer science to figure out your code?

No. I made this version as easy to understand as I could make it. You need to know basic game programming terms and have a good understanding of C++ though. I will upload a "no training wheels" version of the code *eventually*.

###Why don't you have a project for xyz IDE or ABC operating system?

My university uses nothing but Microsoft technologies in the computer science department for their main programming language courses: intro to C, foundations, data structures, game programming, et al. So that means Windows and Visual Studio for pretty much everything. You can get a degree there without setting up a project that uses more than the standard libraries. Plus, projects are a tad easier to set up on other operating systems. Just follow the tutorials on the SFML website.

###Are you the hero we want?

No, but I am the hero you need.
