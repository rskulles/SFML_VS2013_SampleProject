	
	The Game Class handles the games window and main game loop. It is set up to 
	do time based animation. By default the game will draw at 60 frames per 
	second, the window height and width will be 90% of the desktop width and
	height and the window will be positioned at center and top of the desktop.
	
	The main use of this class is for learning, not production quality code or
	to show off how great I am at C++. The amount of code voodoo and trickery 
	has been kept to a bare minimum. If you don't understand something completly, 
	just take it as *PMF. It was either meant for you not to mess with or I forgot 
	(read: to lazy) to comment what the code did.

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Common conventions used in the creation of this class. You are free to do what ever
	you want. Trust me. My mom said it was okay.
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	---------------
	public methods:
	---------------
	
	Public methods are written in camel case with the first letter capitalized.
	
	int	MySuperCoolFunctin();
	
	----------------
	-public members:
	----------------
	
	<Sarcasm> Public members, fields or whatever you want to call them don't exist...
	so why would you eveen try to use them.</Sarcasm> 

	Any public members in the class will follow the rules for public methods

	enumeration class MyEnumerations { the things enumerated here};

	---------------------------
	private methods and members
	---------------------------

	Private methods and members are written in camel case with the first letter
	lower case. The methods are prefixed with an '_' and the members are
	prefixed with 'm_'. Private methods and members are separated
	by different private keywords. If their is one thing I would suggest
	following yourself, it is at least placing members and methods into
	these spots.

	private://methods
	void _mySuperPrivateFunction();
	void _myOtherSuperPrivateFunction();
	
	private://members
	int m_mySuperPrivateMember;
	bool m_myOtherSuperPrivateMember;

	other notes:
	------------

	I don't have any using directives set up. I don't use them. If you do, set them up yo'self.
	
	I tend to slip into modern C++ style code. Most universities and teach yourself books don't use modern C++.
	If C++ is your main programming language, I would definitly suggest learning modern C++ practices.

	I tried to make the names of things so overly descriptive it hurts. 
	
	Methods are commented in the .cpp file. Furthermore, they should be commented to all hell.
	
	Don't form a lynch mob in search of me because of your religious beliefs in coding style. We are all wrong.
	
	Hopefully this helps you to get started making a game quick and easy. If not read the first few words of the
	previous comment.
	
	Have fun.
